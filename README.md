  <h1>🍽️✨ Masterchef Recipes App ✨🍽️</h1>
</div>

Welcome to the Masterchef Recipes App! This is an iOS app developed in SwiftUI, designed for cooking enthusiasts to explore and discover a variety of delicious recipes inspired by the Masterchef universe.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **AWS Integration:** I utilized AWS cloud storage services S3 Bucket to host and manage recipe images, providing a seamless and efficient user experience.
 
- **API and MVVM Architecture:** We implement core API functions to provide access to a variety of recipes. The MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture ensures a clear separation between business logic and user interface.
  
- **Property Wrappers for Data Flow:** I used SwiftUI property wrappers such as `@Published` and `@Binding` to manage data flow between different app components, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
  
- **Back-end in TypeScript:** The app is complemented by a robust and scalable backend developed in TypeScript, powering the app with up-to-date data.
